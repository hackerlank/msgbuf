msgbuf
Message buffer in C++

Given an input file containing message declaration, this simple tool generate the code that allows to easily serialize/unserialize data.

msgbuf tries to simplement some features (in fact a very limited subset) supported by tools like google protobuf or ASN.1

Characteristics:
Simple language definition
Output a single standard .h file, without requiring you to link with other libs
Very simple to use
Uses inheritance (all Messages inherit from a base class)
Space efficient serialization
Simple versionning
Automatically and transparently handle big/little endian conversion
Portable

NOTE: If you have more advanced needs, you might want to look at better (but more complex) alternatives such as google protobuf or ASN.1

Compilation:
g++ *.cc -o msgbuf
